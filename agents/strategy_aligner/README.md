## Purpose

This agent processes strategic documents, business plans, and organizational goals to:
- Extract key strategic themes and objectives
- Identify strategic priorities and constraints
- Analyze alignment between different strategic initiatives
- Provide strategic context for idea generation and roadmap synthesis

## Features

- **Strategic Document Analysis**: Parse and understand strategic documents
- **Objective Extraction**: Identify and categorize business objectives
- **Alignment Assessment**: Evaluate alignment between initiatives and goals
- **Strategic Context Generation**: Provide strategic insights for other agents

## Development

This agent can be developed and tested independently:

### Setup
```bash
# From the agent directory
cd agents/strategy_aligner

# Install dependencies
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests for this agent
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific components

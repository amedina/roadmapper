# Roadmap Synthesis Agent

The Roadmap Synthesis Agent synthesizes information from all other agents to create comprehensive, actionable roadmaps.

## Purpose

This agent acts as the final orchestrator that:
- Integrates insights from Document Loader, Strategy Aligner, and Ideation agents
- Synthesizes comprehensive roadmaps with timelines and priorities
- Ensures strategic alignment across all roadmap elements
- Generates actionable deliverables and milestones

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Integration**: Synthesize inputs from all system agents
- **Timeline Generation**: Create realistic timelines with dependencies
- **Priority Ranking**: Rank initiatives based on strategic importance
- **Resource Planning**: Consider resource constraints and allocation
- **Roadmap Visualization**: Generate visual roadmap representations
- **Actionable Outputs**: Create detailed action plans and deliverables

## Development

This agent can be developed and tested independently:

### Setup
```bash
# From the agent directory
cd agents/roadmap_synthesis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests for this agent
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific components
python -m pytest tests/test_roadmap_synthesizer.py
python -m pytest tests/test_timeline_generator.py
python -m pytest tests/test_priority_ranker.py
```

### Examples
```bash
# Run roadmap synthesis examples
python examples/roadmap_synthesis_example.py

# Or from root directory
python -m agents.roadmap_synthesis.examples.roadmap_synthesis_example
```

## Integration

- **Input**: 
  - Documents and embeddings from Document Loader Agent
  - Strategic context from Strategy Aligner Agent
  - Ideas and solutions from Ideation Agent
- **Output**: Comprehensive roadmaps with timelines, priorities, and action plans
